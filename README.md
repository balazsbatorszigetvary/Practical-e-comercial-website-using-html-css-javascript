Practical-e-comercial-website-using-html-css-javascript

The objective of this practical project was to refine my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I concentrated on refining my skill in using keyframes within CSS to ensure the website's responsiveness across various screen sizes. In the domain of JavaScript, I implemented the filter method to dynamically sort and display products based on user-selected filter options. Notably, the product data originates from an array of objects, imbuing the website with a dynamic and adaptable nature.
